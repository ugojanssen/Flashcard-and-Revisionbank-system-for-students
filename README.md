# Flashcard-and-Revisionbank-system-for-students

For my Computer Science Internal Assessment, I developed a website for a client—my friend’s younger brother—who needed assistance with studying for his IB Diploma subjects. He was struggling with terminology and small mark questions despite understanding problem-solving concepts.

To address this, I created a flashcard system that allows him to actively recall information on various topics across different subjects. The website also features a revision bank where he can access specific information related to the topics he selects. This tool enhances his study methods and improves his exam performance.
